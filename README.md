# Fabric-handsonlab-alsocloudsummit
Hands-on lab with Microsoft Fabric: prepare a dataset, use Copilot in Power BI to create self-service dashboards, and transform insights into podcast-style audio. Note: Copilot requires an F2 SKU in Azure (not included in the Fabric trial, but pausable to avoid costs).
